I created a GitHub page to meet and prove the project log / working diary requirement. The goal of this log website is to make Numerous and thorough log entries, with clear demonstration of a pregressive workflow throughout the games development. The game I will be creating will definitely be a text based RPG in python with an engaging story line, working inventory, combat, navigation and allows the user to enjoy a game experience similar to ZORK and other DOS text adventures.   3:09PM 23/2/2018
