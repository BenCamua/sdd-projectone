I created a GitHub page to meet and prove the project log / working diary requirement. The goal of this log website is to make Numerous and thorough log entries, with clear demonstration of a pregressive workflow throughout the games development. The game I will be creating will definitely be a text based RPG in python with an engaging story line, working inventory, combat, navigation and allows the user to enjoy a game experience similar to ZORK and other DOS text adventures.   3:09PM 23/2/2018

I made an ideas file in my gibhub named Ideas File. The 2/3/2018 entry shows what I have done today. To summarise i have gathered resouces on classes.. but while i do this i created a list of classes to make and developed and planned the functionalities of the game. I plan for the character to be able to monitor their current health, their inventory, interact with objects in a certain order that will effect the ending of the game aswell as a dynamic experience to the game. 3/3/2018

I have successfully learnt about uses and application of classes and functions within a game and in python. This youtube video has helped me really well. "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POQIIKb1BZA" in learning this concept. I have created 2 python files named mustangClassTest.py and gameClassTest.py which also help facilitate my understanding. The development of the project is travelling at a slow rate, but its pace will increase as I get more lessons to work on it. I have created my first class and a game_start() function inside of Game.py . The game_start function will be called as soon as the game starts, will create a player instance, name that player and narrate the stories plot. I plan to do a few more things within game_start() but will conclude on this later. 15/03/18
